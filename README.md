HERE A SHORT PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING HOW YOU PERFORMED THE TASK

To complete the real-time chat application, I used HTML for structuring the web pages, CSS for styling the user interface, and JavaScript to handle the interactive and dynamic functionality. We implemented real-time messaging using JavaScript, possibly with the help of WebSocket or a service like Firebase, to ensure that messages are instantly delivered and displayed. The design focused on creating a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to send and receive messages in real time without needing to refresh the page.
